# Challenge_tata
This is a challeng by Tata Innoverse Solver Hunt4 -2019.The challenge is as follows:

    -Whenever a new challenge is uploaded on www.tatainnoverse.com the tool/application/App will extract the relevant keywords for solution scouting.
    -The list of keywords will then be shared with the user, in a document, for verification.
    -The user (of the tool) will verify the keywords, edit them if necessary and then feed these keywords to the tool again.
    -The tool will then crawl through the internet, extract information as per the keyword list and store all accumulated information in a document.
    -Depending upon the ‘extent of relevance’ given by the user, the number of results could be controlled
    -The search should happen across all types of contents freely available on the web.The information stored in a document will be properly formatted and clubbed in correspondence to each keyword.
